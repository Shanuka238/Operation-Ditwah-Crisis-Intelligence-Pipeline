       "All three branches yield the same total priority score of 21. However, they differ significantly in total travel time: Branch 1 (Greedy) and Branch 2 (Speed) both result in 50 minutes of travel time, while Branch 3 (Logistics) requires 100 minutes. The trade-off here is between the efficiency of the route (travel time) and the priority of incidents. Since both the Greedy and Speed approaches yield the same sequence and travel time, and given that they both maximize the priority score while minimizing travel time compared to the Logistics approach, either could be considered optimal depending on the specific goals of the mission. However, given the constraints and the goal to maximize the total priority score while considering travel time, the sequence ID3, ID2, ID1 (starting with the highest priority incident that is also the closest to the starting point) is the most efficient and effective approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommended Optimal Route**\n",
       "The recommended sequence is ID3, ID2, ID1, which combines the benefits of starting with a high-priority incident (ID3) that is at the starting location, followed by another high-priority incident (ID2) that is close, and finally addressing the lower-priority but still important incident (ID1). This approach balances the need to assist those in need quickly with the practical consideration of travel time, thereby optimizing the use of the single rescue boat."
